            The Aegis of Champions is a physical trophy that is awarded to the
            winners of The International tournament. It was forged out of bronze
            and silver by Weta Workshop in 2012. The reverse side of the trophy
            is engraved with the names and handles of each player on the winning
            team of The International each year.
